Subject: [PATCH 0/8] crypto: AF_ALG: add AEAD and RNG support

Hi,

This patch set adds AEAD and RNG support to the AF_ALG interface
exported by the kernel crypto API. By extending AF_ALG with AEAD and RNG
support, all cipher types the kernel crypto API allows access to are
now accessible from userspace.

The RNG support is stand-alone.

The AEAD implementation is added to algif_skcipher.c to prevent
re-implementation of the memory moving logic.

The extension for the AEAD support can be summarized with the following
types of changes:

        * select the correct crypto API functions (either the ablkcipher
          or the aead functions)

        * apply the additional data needed for AEAD at the right time
          (associated data, authentication tag) -- this includes the addition
          of user space interfaces to allow setting this data.

        * add the calculation for the memory size needed for encryption and
          decryption.

In addition, the patch set adds a getsockopt implementation to skcipher to
allow user space to inquire about properties of the ciphers (IV size,
block size, authentication data size). This extension would be needed for a
generic user space usage of these ciphers.

The new AEAD and RNG interfaces are fully tested with the test application
provided at [1]. That test application exercises all newly added user space
interfaces.

The patch set was tested on x86_64 and i386.
